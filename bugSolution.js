// Ensure proper Tailwind configuration and build process
// ... (Tailwind configuration files)

// Correct class order and avoid conflicts
<div class="p-4 bg-red-500">
  <p>This text should now be red and have padding.</p>
</div>
// Add !important only as a last resort after carefully investigating other causes of style conflicts.
