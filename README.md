# Intermittent Tailwind CSS Styling Issues

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied, leading to unexpected styling behavior.  The issue seems related to class order or potential conflicts.

## Bug Description

Certain Tailwind classes are not rendering correctly, resulting in missing styles (e.g., background color, padding). This problem does not occur consistently and appears to be intermittent, making it difficult to debug reliably. 

## Reproduction

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start a development server.
4. Observe that the text in the example div does not consistently display the expected styles applied via Tailwind classes. 

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking for conflicting CSS rules, ensuring correct Tailwind class order, and verifying that Tailwind is properly configured and compiled.
